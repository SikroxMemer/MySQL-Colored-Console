# MySQL Python Console

The MySQL Python Console is a customized version of the MySQL shell that allows you to interact with a MySQL database using Python. It provides a user-friendly interface for executing SQL queries and managing your database, while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Python programming language.

This project is built on top of the `mysql-connector` library for Python and enhances the console experience using the `rich` library for enhanced text formatting and visualization.
